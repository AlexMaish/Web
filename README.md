# Web-Based Project

## 🌐 Overview

This is a web-based project developed as part of my personal portfolio. The project demonstrates my ability to design, build, and structure modern web applications while following clean code principles and best practices.

The goal of this project is to showcase both my **technical skills** and my **problem-solving approach** in web development.
